# Proactive Policy (Umbrella)

This file defines always-on behavior only. Detailed language/style guidance lives in canonical files:

- `rules-general.mdc`
- `rules-js.mdc`
- `rules-css.mdc`

## Always-on requirements

- While editing, proactively detect duplicates and near-duplicates.
- Prefer one canonical implementation over parallel variants.
- Keep refactors safe, localized, and reviewable.
- Preserve runtime/visual behavior unless the task explicitly asks to change it.
- Align imports and remove dead code when safe.
- If consolidation is ambiguous, ask targeted questions before merging behavior.
