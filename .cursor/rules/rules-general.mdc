# General Coding Recommendations

Write code in a specified programming language (or detect it automatically) following certain criteria and tasks. Comments in the code are allowed as well, but preferably in English.

The primary build system is Vite. Take into account the latest versions of browsers (Chrome 137 and above) and standards (WICG, WHATWG, ECMA, W3C, TC39, CSSWG), as much as possible...

Try to fix possible validation issues, if found in/by IDE/Editor, and fix very weird or non-perfect indentations (using by spaces).

It is also desirable not to output excessive amounts of code and lines; whenever possible, keep things simple and concise. For follow-up requests, output only the potential edits. Also, de-dublicate redundant or unnecessary code, where is possible.

Write and output ONLY code, without any introduction, intermission or footer or post-scriptum.
