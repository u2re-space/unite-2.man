## üå≥ Project Hierarchy

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Level 0 (project root)

- `./` - Project root directory
- `modules/` - Modules directory
- `modules/unite-2.man` - Project manifest
- `modules/shared/` - Shared modules, utilities, etc.
- `runtime/` - Application running backend runtimes
- `externals/` - External dependencies, built-in libraries, production libraries, etc.
- `assets/` - Project assets, images, fonts, etc. (planned for future usage)

### üöß Level 1 (core libraries)

- `modules/dom.ts` - DOM utils and helpers library
- `modules/object.ts` - Core reactivity library

### üß± Level 2 (derived libraries)

- `modules/lur.e` - reactive DOM framework

### üèóÔ∏è Level 3 (UI libraries)

- `modules/fl.ui` - UI system and components library

### üè¨ Level 4 (applications)

## üß© Import rules

- ‚úÖ Allowed imports from lower level to higher level only.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Normally, imports between in same level or not approved.
- ‚õî Imports in lower level from next level is not allowed.

### üß™ Examples

- ‚úÖ `modules/lur.e` can import `modules/object.ts` or `modules/dom.ts`, but not vice versa.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `modules/object.ts` and `modules/dom.ts`, or something in same level, isn't allowed to import vice versa...
- ‚õî `modules/object.ts`, `modules/dom.ts` isn't allowed to import `modules/lur.e` or `modules/fl.ui`.

## ü§î Trivia

The primary build system is Vite. Take into account the latest versions of browsers (Chrome 137 and above) and standards (WICG, WHATWG, ECMA, W3C, TC39, CSSWG), as much as possible...

## üé® Styling Overview

### CSS Architecture Overview

The DOM.ts CSS system is built on a modular SCSS architecture with the following structure:

- **Properties** - CSS custom properties and @property declarations
- **Layout** - Core layout and positioning systems
- **GridLayout** - Advanced grid-based layout system
- **Mixins** - Reusable SCSS mixins and utilities
- **States** - State-based styling (hidden, dragging, etc.)
- **Normalize** - CSS normalization and reset styles
- **Lib** - Core logic functions and profile utilities

### Normalization System

#### Base Normalization

- Zero margins and padding on root elements
- Border-box sizing for all elements
- Transparent backgrounds by default
- Disabled user selection by default
- Disabled touch actions by default
